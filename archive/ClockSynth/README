This was merely an initial prototype to prove the base design of the 
PCGM (Programmable Clock Generator Module). 

There were only 2 boards of this type built. They worked and demonstrated the 
validity of the general concept from which the PCGM was then based.

The PCGM was then manufactured and sold by Micro-Node.

The ClockSynth takes 10MHz and converts it to 14.4MHz, the reference oscillator 
used in the Motorola Maxtrac/Radius, and the like.

The schematic here was supplied by Jim, and is believed to be accurate.
