Title:		SPLAT!
Version:	1.4.0
Entered-date:	2011-03-14
Description:	SPLAT! is a terrestrial RF propagation analysis tool for
		the spectrum between 20 MHz and 20 GHz.  SPLAT! provides
		site engineering data such as the great circle distances
		and bearings between sites, antenna elevation angles
		(uptilt), depression angles (downtilt), antenna height
		above mean sea level, antenna height above average
		terrain, bearings and distances to known obstructions,
		path loss, received power level, received power density,
		and signal strength based on the ITWOM Irregular Terrain
		With Obstructions Model, and minimum antenna height
		requirements needed to establish first Fresnel zone
		clearance and line-of-sight RF paths absent of obstructions
		due to terrain.  SPLAT! produces reports, graphs, and highly
		detailed and carefully annotated topographic maps
		depicting line-of-sight paths, path loss, and expected
		coverage areas of transmitters and repeater systems.
		Applications of SPLAT! include site engineering, wireless
		network design, amateur radio communications, frequency
		coordination, communication system design, and terrestrial
		radio and HDTV television broadcasting.  SPLAT! requires
		gnuplot version 3.7, libbzip-1.0.1 or later, and zlib, as
		well as an application capable of displaying PPM graphic
		files (xv, ImageMagick, xpaint, The GIMP, etc.).
