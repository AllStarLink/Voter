Baseband Examination Window

Typically, the discriminator of an FM communications receiver produces 
results containing audio spectrum from the "sub-audible" range 
(typically < 100 Hz) to well above frequencies able to be produced by 
modulating audio. These higher frequencies can be utilized to determine 
signal quality, since they can only contain noise (or no noise, if a 
sufficiently strong signal is present).

For receivers (such as the Motorola Quantar, etc) that do not provide 
sufficient spectral content at these "noise" frequencies (for various 
reasons), The "DSP/BEW (Digital Signal Processor / Baseband Examination 
Window)" feature of the RTCM firmware may be utilized. 

These receivers are perfectly capable of providing valid "noise" signal 
with no modulation on the input of the receiver, but with strong 
modulation (high frequency audio and high deviation), it severely 
interferes with proper analysis of signal strength.

This feature provides a means by which a "Window" of baseband (normal 
audio range) signal is examined by a DSP and a determination of whether 
or not sufficient audio is present to cause interference of proper 
signal strength is made. During the VERY brief periods of time when it 
is determined that sufficient audio is present to cause interference, 
the signal strength value is "held" (the last valid value previous to 
the time of interference) until such time that the interfering audio is 
no longer present.  

The DSP/BEW feature is selectable, and should not be used for a receiver 
that does not need it.
