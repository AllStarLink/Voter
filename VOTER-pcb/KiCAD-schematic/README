This is a re-draw of the original VOTER Eagle schematics, using KiCAD 6.0.

The original schematic has been broken up in to sheets, based on function. All of the analog signal processing is on one sheet, digital processing on another sheet, and I/O on another sheet.

This is to allow for better visualisation of how the circuit functions.

This schematic is correct and accurate as far as can be determined, however, use at your own risk.

A PDF export is provided for review.
