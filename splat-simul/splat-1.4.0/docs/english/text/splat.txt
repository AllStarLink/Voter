DESCRIPTION
       SPLAT!  is  a  powerful terrestrial RF propagation and terrain analysis
       tool for the spectrum between 20 MHz and 20 GHz.  SPLAT! is free  soft-
       ware,  and  is  designed for operation on Unix and Linux-based worksta-
       tions.  Redistribution and/or modification is permitted under the terms
       of  the GNU General Public License, Version 2, as published by the Free
       Software Foundation.  Adoption of SPLAT!  source code in proprietary or
       closed-source  applications  is  a  violation  of  this  license and is
       strictly forbidden.

       SPLAT! is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  but  WITHOUT
       ANY  WARRANTY,  without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
       FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General  Public  License
       for more details.

INTRODUCTION
       Applications of SPLAT! include the visualization, design, and link bud-
       get analysis of wireless Wide Area Networks (WANs), commercial and ama-
       teur  radio  communication  systems above 20 MHz, microwave links, fre-
       quency coordination and interference studies,  and  the  prediction  of
       analog and digital terrestrial radio and television contour regions.

       SPLAT! provides RF site engineering data such as great circle distances
       and bearings between sites, antenna elevation angles (uptilt),  depres-
       sion  angles  (downtilt),  antenna height above mean sea level, antenna
       height above average terrain, bearings, distances,  and  elevations  to
       known  obstructions,  Irregular  Terrain  Model  path  attenuation, and
       received signal strength.  In  addition,  the  minimum  antenna  height
       requirements  needed  to clear terrain, the first Fresnel zone, and any
       user-definable percentage of the first Fresnel zone are also  provided.

       SPLAT!  produces  reports, graphs, and high resolution topographic maps
       that depict line-of-sight paths, and  regional  path  loss  and  signal
       strength contours through which expected coverage areas of transmitters
       and repeater systems can be obtained.   When  performing  line-of-sight
       and  Irregular  Terrain  Model  analyses  in  situations where multiple
       transmitter or repeater sites are employed, SPLAT! determines  individ-
       ual and mutual areas of coverage within the network specified.

INPUT FILES
       SPLAT!  is  a  command-line  driven  application  and  reads input data
       through  a  number  of  data  files.   Some  files  are  mandatory  for
       successful execution of the program, while others are optional.  Manda-
       tory files include digital elevation topography models in the  form  of
       SPLAT  Data  Files  (SDF  files),  site location files (QTH files), and
       Irregular Terrain Model parameter files (LRP  files).   Optional  files
       include  city location files, cartographic boundary files, user-defined
       terrain files, path loss input files, antenna radiation pattern  files,
       and color definition files.

SPLAT DATA FILES
       SPLAT! imports topographic data in the form of SPLAT Data Files (SDFs).
       These files may be generated from a number of information sources.   In
       the United States, SPLAT Data Files can be generated through U.S.  Geo-
       logical Survey Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using  the  postdownload
       and  usgs2sdf  utilities  included with SPLAT!.  USGS Digital Elevation
       Models  compatible  with  these  utilities  may  be  downloaded   from:
       http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/DEM/250/.

       Significantly  better  resolution  and accuracy can be obtained through
       the use of SRTM Version 2 digital  elevation  models,  especially  when
       supplemented  by USGS-derived SDF data.  These one-degree by one-degree
       models are the product of the Space  Shuttle  STS-99  Radar  Topography
       Mission,  and  are  available  for most populated regions of the Earth.
       SPLAT Data Files may be generated from 3 arc-second SRTM-3  data  using
       the  included  srtm2sdf utility.  SRTM-3 Version 2 data may be obtained
       through anonymous  FTP  from:  ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov:21/srtm/ver-
       sion2/SRTM3/

       Note  that  SRTM  filenames  refer to the latitude and longitude of the
       southwest corner of the topographic dataset contained within the  file.
       Therefore,  the region of interest must lie north and east of the lati-
       tude and longitude provided in the SRTM filename.

       The srtm2sdf utility may also be used to convert 3-arc second SRTM data
       in  Band  Interleaved  by Line (.BIL) format for use with SPLAT!.  This
       data  is  available  via  the  web  at:   http://seamless.usgs.gov/web-
       site/seamless/

       Band  Interleaved  by  Line  data must be downloaded in a very specific
       manner to be compatible  with  srtm2sdf  and  SPLAT!.   Please  consult
       srtm2sdf's  documentation  for  instructions  on downloading .BIL topo-
       graphic data through the USGS's Seamless Web Site.

       Even greater resolution and accuracy can be obtained by  using  1  arc-
       second  SRTM-1  Version  2 topography data.  This data is available for
       the United States and its territories and possessions, and may be down-
       loaded from: ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov:21/srtm/version2/SRTM1/

       High  resolution SDF files for use with SPLAT! HD may be generated from
       data in this format using the srtm2sdf-hd utility.

       Despite the higher accuracy that SRTM data has to offer, some voids  in
       the  data  sets  exist.   When  voids  are  detected,  the srtm2sdf and
       srtm2sdf-hd utilities replace them with  corresponding  data  found  in
       usgs2sdf  generated  SDF files.  If USGS-derived SDF data is not avail-
       able, voids are handled through adjacent  pixel  averaging,  or  direct
       replacement.

       SPLAT Data Files contain integer value topographic elevations in meters
       referenced to mean sea level for 1-degree by 1-degree  regions  of  the
       Earth.   SDF  files  can  be  read  by SPLAT! in either standard format
       (.sdf) as generated directly by the usgs2sdf, srtm2sdf, and srtm2sdf-hd
       utilities,  or  in  bzip2  compressed  format (.sdf.bz2).  Since uncom-
       pressed files can be read slightly faster than  files  that  have  been
       compressed,  SPLAT! searches for needed SDF data in uncompressed format
       first.  If uncompressed data cannot be located,  SPLAT!  then  searches
       for data in bzip2 compressed format.  If no compressed SDF files can be
       found for the region requested,  SPLAT!  assumes  the  region  is  over
       water, and will assign an elevation of sea-level to these areas.

       This  feature  of SPLAT! makes it possible to perform path analysis not
       only over land, but also between coastal areas not represented by Digi-
       tal  Elevation  Model  data.   However, this behavior of SPLAT!  under-
       scores the importance of having all the  SDF  files  required  for  the
       region being analyzed if meaningful results are to be expected.

SITE LOCATION (QTH) FILES
       SPLAT!  imports  site  location information of transmitter and receiver
       sites analyzed by the program from ASCII files having a .qth extension.
       QTH  files  contain  the  site's name, the site's latitude (positive if
       North of the equator, negative if  South),  the  site's  longitude  (in
       degrees West, 0 to 360 degrees, or degrees East 0 to -360 degrees), and
       the site's antenna height above ground level (AGL), each separated by a
       single line-feed character.  The antenna height is assumed to be speci-
       fied in feet unless followed by the letter m  or  the  word  meters  in
       either  upper or lower case.  Latitude and longitude information may be
       expressed in either decimal format (74.6864) or degree, minute,  second
       (DMS) format (74 41 11.0).

       For  example,  a site location file describing television station WNJT-
       DT, Trenton, NJ (wnjt-dt.qth) might read as follows:

               WNJT-DT
               40.2828
               74.6864
               990.00

       Each transmitter and receiver site analyzed by SPLAT!  must  be  repre-
       sented by its own site location (QTH) file.

IRREGULAR TERRAIN MODEL PARAMETER (LRP) FILES
       Irregular  Terrain  Model  Parameter data files are required for SPLAT!
       to determine RF path loss, field strength,  or  received  signal  power
       level in either point-to-point or area prediction mode.  Irregular Ter-
       rain Model parameter data is read from files having the same base  name
       as  the  transmitter  site QTH file, but with a .lrp extension.  SPLAT!
       LRP files share the following format (wnjt-dt.lrp):

               15.000  ; Earth Dielectric Constant (Relative permittivity)
               0.005   ; Earth Conductivity (Siemens per meter)
               301.000 ; Atmospheric Bending Constant (N-units)
               647.000 ; Frequency in MHz (20 MHz to 20 GHz)
               5       ; Radio Climate (5 = Continental Temperate)
               0       ; Polarization (0 = Horizontal, 1 = Vertical)
               0.50    ; Fraction of situations (50% of locations)
               0.90    ; Fraction of time (90% of the time)
               46000.0 ; Effective Radiated Power (ERP) in Watts (optional)

       If an LRP file corresponding to the tx_site QTH file cannot  be  found,
       SPLAT!  scans  the  current working directory for the file "splat.lrp".
       If this file cannot be found, then default parameters will be  assigned
       by SPLAT! and a corresponding "splat.lrp" file containing these default
       parameters will be written to the current working directory.  The  gen-
       erated "splat.lrp" file can then be edited by the user as needed.

       Typical  Earth dielectric constants and conductivity values are as fol-
       lows:
                                  Dielectric Constant  Conductivity
               Salt water       :        80                5.000
               Good ground      :        25                0.020
               Fresh water      :        80                0.010
               Marshy land      :        12                0.007
               Farmland, forest :        15                0.005
               Average ground   :        15                0.005
               Mountain, sand   :        13                0.002
               City             :         5                0.001
               Poor ground      :         4                0.001

       Radio climate codes used by SPLAT! are as follows:

               1: Equatorial (Congo)
               2: Continental Subtropical (Sudan)
               3: Maritime Subtropical (West coast of Africa)
               4: Desert (Sahara)
               5: Continental Temperate
               6: Maritime Temperate, over land (UK and west coasts  of  US  &
       EU)
               7: Maritime Temperate, over sea

       The Continental Temperate climate is common to large land masses in the
       temperate zone, such as the United States.  For paths shorter than  100
       km, there is little difference between Continental and Maritime Temper-
       ate climates.

       The seventh and eighth parameters in the .lrp file  correspond  to  the
       statistical  analysis  provided  by  the  ITM  model.  In this example,
       SPLAT! will return the maximum path loss  occurring  50%  of  the  time
       (fraction  of time, or Time Variability) in 90% of situations (fraction
       of situations, or Location Variability).   This  is  often  denoted  as
       F(50,90)  in  Longley-Rice  studies.  In the United States, an F(50,90)
       criteria is typically used for digital television (8-level VSB  modula-
       tion), while F(50,50) is used for analog (VSB-AM+NTSC) broadcasts.

       For  further  information  on  ITM propagation model parameters, please
       refer to: http://flattop.its.bldrdoc.gov/itm.html and  http://www.soft-
       wright.com/faq/engineering/prop_longley_rice.html

       The  last  parameter  in the .lrp file corresponds to the transmitter's
       Effective Radiated Power (ERP), and is optional.  If it is included  in
       the .lrp file, then SPLAT! will compute received signal strength levels
       and field strength level contours when performing ITM studies.  If  the
       parameter  is omitted, path loss is computed instead.  The ERP provided
       in the .lrp file can be overridden by using SPLAT!'s -erp  command-line
       switch.   If the .lrp file contains an ERP parameter and the generation
       of path loss rather than field strength contours is  desired,  the  ERP
       can  be  assigned  to zero using the -erp switch without having to edit
       the .lrp file to accomplish the same result.

CITY LOCATION FILES
       The names and locations of cities, tower  sites,  or  other  points  of
       interest  may  be imported and plotted on topographic maps generated by
       SPLAT!.  SPLAT! imports the names of cities and  locations  from  ASCII
       files  containing the location of interest's name, latitude, and longi-
       tude.  Each field is separated by a comma.  Each record is separated by
       a  single  line  feed  character.  As was the case with the .qth files,
       latitude and longitude information may be entered in either decimal  or
       degree, minute, second (DMS) format.

       For example (cities.dat):

               Teaneck, 40.891973, 74.014506
               Tenafly, 40.919212, 73.955892
               Teterboro, 40.859511, 74.058908
               Tinton Falls, 40.279966, 74.093924
               Toms River, 39.977777, 74.183580
               Totowa, 40.906160, 74.223310
               Trenton, 40.219922, 74.754665

       A total of five separate city data files may be imported at a time, and
       there is no limit to the size of these files.  SPLAT! reads  city  data
       on  a  "first  come/first served" basis, and plots only those locations
       whose annotations do not conflict with annotations  of  locations  read
       earlier  in  the  current  city  data file, or in previous files.  This
       behavior minimizes clutter in SPLAT! generated  topographic  maps,  but
       also  mandates  that important locations be placed toward the beginning
       of the first city data file, and locations less important be positioned
       further down the list or in subsequent data files.

       City  data  files  may  be  generated  manually  using any text editor,
       imported from other sources, or derived from data  available  from  the
       U.S.  Census Bureau using the citydecoder utility included with SPLAT!.
       Such  data  is  available  free  of  charge  via   the   Internet   at:
       http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/bdy_files.html,  and must be in ASCII
       format.

CARTOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY DATA FILES
       Cartographic boundary data may also be imported to plot the  boundaries
       of cities, counties, or states on topographic maps generated by SPLAT!.
       Such data must be of the form of  ARC/INFO  Ungenerate  (ASCII  Format)
       Metadata  Cartographic  Boundary Files, and are available from the U.S.
       Census    Bureau    via    the     Internet     at:     http://www.cen-
       sus.gov/geo/www/cob/co2000.html#ascii        and        http://www.cen-
       sus.gov/geo/www/cob/pl2000.html#ascii.  A total of five separate carto-
       graphic  boundary files may be imported at a time.  It is not necessary
       to import state boundaries  if  county  boundaries  have  already  been
       imported.

PROGRAM OPERATION
       SPLAT!  is  invoked via the command-line using a series of switches and
       arguments.  Since SPLAT! is a CPU  and  memory  intensive  application,
       this  type  of  interface  minimizes  overhead and lends itself well to
       scripted (batch) operations.  SPLAT!'s CPU and memory scheduling prior-
       ity may be modified through the use of the Unix nice command.

       The  number and type of switches passed to SPLAT! determine its mode of
       operation and method of output data generation.  Nearly all of SPLAT!'s
       switches may be cascaded in any order on the command line when invoking
       the program.

       Simply typing splat on the  command  line  will  return  a  summary  of
       SPLAT!'s command line options:

                    --==[ SPLAT! v1.4.0 Available Options... ]==--

            -t txsite(s).qth (max of 4 with -c, max of 30 with -L)
            -r rxsite.qth
            -c plot coverage of TX(s) with an RX antenna at X feet/meters AGL
            -L plot path loss map of TX based on an RX at X feet/meters AGL

          -geo generate an Xastir .geo georeference file (with .ppm output)
          -dbm plot signal power level contours rather than field strength
        -gpsav preserve gnuplot temporary working files after SPLAT! execution
       -metric employ metric rather than  imperial  units  for  all  user  I/O
       -olditm invoke older ITM propagation model rather than the newer ITWOM

       The command-line options for splat and splat-hd are identical.

       SPLAT!  operates  in  two distinct modes: point-to-point mode, and area
       prediction mode.  Either a line-of-sight  (LOS)  or  Irregular  Terrain
       (ITM)  propagation model may be invoked by the user.  True Earth, four-
       thirds Earth, or any other user-defined Earth radius may  be  specified
       when performing line-of-sight analysis.

POINT-TO-POINT ANALYSIS
       SPLAT!  may  be  used to perform line-of-sight terrain analysis between
       two specified site locations.  For example:

       splat -t tx_site.qth -r rx_site.qth

       invokes a line-of-sight terrain analysis between the transmitter speci-
       fied  in tx_site.qth and receiver specified in rx_site.qth using a True
       Earth radius model, and writes a SPLAT! Path  Analysis  Report  to  the
       current  working  directory.  The report contains details of the trans-
       mitter and receiver sites, and identifies the location of any  obstruc-
       tions  detected along the line-of-sight path.  If an obstruction can be
       cleared by raising the receive antenna to a  greater  altitude,  SPLAT!
       will  indicate  the minimum antenna height required for a line-of-sight
       path to exist between the transmitter and receiver locations specified.
       Note that imperial units (miles, feet) are specified unless the -metric
       switch is added to SPLAT!'s command line options:

       splat -t tx_site.qth -r rx_site.qth -metric

       If the antenna must be raised a significant amount, this  determination
       may take a few moments.  Note that the results provided are the minimum
       necessary for a line-of-sight path to exist, and in the  case  of  this
       simple  example,  do  not take Fresnel zone clearance requirements into
       consideration.

       qth extensions are assumed by SPLAT! for QTH files,  and  are  optional
       when  specifying -t and -r arguments on the command-line.  SPLAT! auto-
       matically reads all SPLAT Data Files necessary to conduct  the  terrain
       analysis  between  the  sites  specified.   SPLAT!   searches  for  the
       required SDF files in the current  working  directory  first.   If  the
       needed  files are not found, SPLAT! then searches in the path specified
       by the -d command-line switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -d /cdrom/sdf/

       An external directory path may be specified by placing a  ".splat_path"
       file  under the user's home directory.  This file must contain the full
       directory path of last resort to all the SDF files.  The  path  in  the
       $HOME/.splat_path  file  must  be of the form of a single line of ASCII
       text:

       /opt/splat/sdf/

       and can be generated using any text editor.

       A graph of the terrain profile between  the  receiver  and  transmitter
       locations  as a function of distance from the receiver can be generated
       by adding the -p switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -p terrain_profile.png

       SPLAT! invokes gnuplot when generating graphs.  The filename  extension
       specified  to SPLAT! determines the format of the graph produced.  .png
       will produce a 640x480 color PNG graphic file, while .ps or .postscript
       will  produce  postscript output.  Output in formats such as GIF, Adobe
       Illustrator, AutoCAD dxf, LaTeX, and many others are available.  Please
       consult  gnuplot,  and  gnuplot's  documentation for details on all the
       supported output formats.

       A graph of elevations subtended by the terrain between the receiver and
       transmitter  as  a function of distance from the receiver can be gener-
       ated by using the -e switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -e elevation_profile.png

       The graph produced using this  switch  illustrates  the  elevation  and
       depression  angles  resulting  from  the terrain between the receiver's
       location  and  the  transmitter  site  from  the  perspective  of   the
       receiver's  location.   A second trace is plotted between the left side
       of the graph (receiver's location) and the location of the transmitting
       antenna  on  the  right.   This  trace  illustrates the elevation angle
       required for a line-of-sight path to exist  between  the  receiver  and
       transmitter  locations.   If the trace intersects the elevation profile
       at any point on the graph, then this is an indication that  a  line-of-
       sight  path does not exist under the conditions given, and the obstruc-
       tions can be clearly identified on the graph at the point(s) of  inter-
       section.

       A  graph illustrating terrain height referenced to a line-of-sight path
       between the transmitter and receiver may  be  generated  using  the  -h
       switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -h height_profile.png

       A  terrain  height  plot  normalized  to  the  transmitter and receiver
       antenna heights can be obtained using the -H switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -H normalized_height_profile.png

       A contour of the Earth's curvature is also plotted in this mode.

       The first Fresnel Zone, and 60% of the first Fresnel Zone can be  added
       to height profile graphs by adding the -f switch, and specifying a fre-
       quency (in MHz) at which the Fresnel Zone should be modeled:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -f 439.250 -H normalized_height_profile.png

       Fresnel Zone clearances other 60% can be specified using the -fz switch
       as follows:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -f 439.250 -fz 75 -H height_profile2.png

       A graph showing ITM path loss may be plotted using the -l switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -l path_loss_profile.png

       As before, adding the -metric switch forces the graphs  to  be  plotted
       using  metric  units of measure.  The -gpsav switch instructs SPLAT! to
       preserve (rather than delete) the gnuplot working files generated  dur-
       ing  SPLAT! execution, allowing the user to edit these files and re-run
       gnuplot if desired.

       When performing a  point-to-point  analysis,  a  SPLAT!  Path  Analysis
       Report  is  generated  in  the form of a text file with a .txt filename
       extension.  The report contains  bearings  and  distances  between  the
       transmitter  and  receiver, as well as the free-space and ITM path loss
       for the path being analyzed.  The mode of propagation for the  path  is
       given  as  Line-of-Sight,  Single  Horizon, Double Horizon, Diffraction
       Dominant, or Troposcatter Dominant.  Additionally, if the  receiver  is
       located  at the peak of a single obstruction or at the peak of a second
       obstruction, SPLAT! will report RX at  Peak  Terrain  Along  Path  when
       operating under the ITWOM propagation model.

       Distances  and  locations  to known obstructions along the path between
       transmitter and receiver  are  also  provided.   If  the  transmitter's
       effective  radiated power is specified in the transmitter's correspond-
       ing .lrp file, then predicted signal strength and  antenna  voltage  at
       the receiving location is also provided in the Path Analysis Report.

       To  determine  the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio at remote location where
       random Johnson (thermal) noise is the primary limiting factor in recep-
       tion:

       SNR=T-NJ-L+G-NF

       where  T  is  the ERP of the transmitter in dBW in the direction of the
       receiver, NJ is Johnson Noise in dBW (-136 dBW for a 6  MHz  television
       channel),  L  is the path loss provided by SPLAT!  in dB (as a positive
       number), G is the receive antenna gain in dB over isotropic, and NF  is
       the receiver noise figure in dB.

       T may be computed as follows:

       T=TI+GT

       where  TI  is  actual  amount of RF power delivered to the transmitting
       antenna in dBW, GT is the transmitting antenna gain (over isotropic) in
       the  direction  of the receiver (or the horizon if the receiver is over
       the horizon).

       To compute how much more signal is available over the minimum to neces-
       sary to achieve a specific signal-to-noise ratio:

       Signal_Margin=SNR-S

       where  S  is  the minimum required SNR ratio (15.5 dB for ATSC (8-level
       VSB) DTV, 42 dB for analog NTSC television).

       A topographic map may be generated by  SPLAT!  to  visualize  the  path
       between  the  transmitter  and receiver sites from yet another perspec-
       tive.  Topographic maps generated by SPLAT! display elevations using  a
       logarithmic  grayscale,  with  higher  elevations  represented  through
       brighter shades of gray.  The dynamic range  of  the  image  is  scaled
       between the highest and lowest elevations present in the map.  The only
       exception to this is sea-level, which is represented  using  the  color
       blue.

       Topographic output is invoked using the -o switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -o topo_map.ppm

       The  .ppm extension on the output filename is assumed by SPLAT!, and is
       optional.

       In this example, topo_map.ppm will  illustrate  the  locations  of  the
       transmitter  and receiver sites specified.  In addition, the great cir-
       cle path between the two sites will be drawn over locations  for  which
       an  unobstructed  path exists to the transmitter at a receiving antenna
       height equal to that of the receiver site (specified in rx_site.qth).

       It may desirable to populate the topographic map with names  and  loca-
       tions  of  cities,  tower  sites, or other important locations.  A city
       file may be passed to SPLAT! using the -s switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -s cities.dat -o topo_map

       Up to five separate city files may be passed to SPLAT! at a  time  fol-
       lowing the -s switch.

       County and state boundaries may be added to the map by specifying up to
       five U.S. Census  Bureau  cartographic  boundary  files  using  the  -b
       switch:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -b co34_d00.dat -o topo_map

       In  situations  where multiple transmitter sites are in use, as many as
       four site locations may be passed to SPLAT! at a time for analysis:

       splat -t tx_site1 tx_site2 tx_site3 tx_site4 -r rx_site -p profile.png

       In this example, four separate terrain profiles and obstruction reports
       will be generated by SPLAT!.  A single topographic map can be specified
       using the -o switch, and line-of-sight paths between  each  transmitter
       and  the  receiver  site indicated will be produced on the map, each in
       its own color.  The path between the first transmitter specified to the
       receiver  will be in green, the path between the second transmitter and
       the receiver will be in cyan, the path between  the  third  transmitter
       and  the  receiver  will  be in violet, and the path between the fourth
       transmitter and the receiver will be in sienna.

       SPLAT! generated topographic maps are 24-bit TrueColor Portable  PixMap
       (PPM)  images.   They  may  be  viewed,  edited,  or converted to other
       graphic formats by popular image viewing applications such as  xv,  The
       GIMP,  ImageMagick,  and  XPaint.  PNG format is highly recommended for
       lossless compressed storage of  SPLAT!   generated  topographic  output
       files.  ImageMagick's command-line utility easily converts SPLAT!'s PPM
       files to PNG format:

       convert splat_map.ppm splat_map.png

       Another excellent PPM to PNG  command-line  utility  is  available  at:
       http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/sources.html.  As a last resort, PPM
       files may be compressed using the bzip2 utility, and read  directly  by
       The GIMP in this format.

       The -ngs option assigns all terrain to the color white, and can be used
       when it is desirable to generate a map that is devoid of terrain:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -b co34_d00.dat -ngs -o white_map

       The resulting .ppm image file can be converted to .png  format  with  a
       transparent background using ImageMagick's convert utility:

       convert -transparent "#FFFFFF" white_map.ppm transparent_map.png

REGIONAL COVERAGE ANALYSIS
       SPLAT! can analyze a transmitter or repeater site, or network of sites,
       and predict the regional coverage for each  site  specified.   In  this
       mode,  SPLAT!  can  generate a topographic map displaying the geometric
       line-of-sight coverage area of the sites based on the location of  each
       site  and the height of receive antenna wishing to communicate with the
       site in question.  A regional analysis may be performed by SPLAT! using
       the -c switch as follows:

       splat -t tx_site -c 30.0 -s cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat -o tx_coverage

       In  this  example,  SPLAT! generates a topographic map called tx_cover-
       age.ppm that illustrates the predicted line-of-sight regional  coverage
       of  tx_site  to  receiving  locations  having  antennas 30.0 feet above
       ground level (AGL).  If the -metric switch is used, the  argument  fol-
       lowing  the  -c switch is interpreted as being in meters rather than in
       feet.  The contents of cities.dat are plotted on the map,  as  are  the
       cartographic boundaries contained in the file co34_d00.dat.

       When  plotting  line-of-sight  paths  and  areas  of regional coverage,
       SPLAT! by default does not account for the effects of atmospheric bend-
       ing.   However, this behavior may be modified by using the Earth radius
       multiplier (-m) switch:

       splat -t wnjt-dt -c 30.0 -m 1.333  -s  cities.dat  -b  counties.dat  -o
       map.ppm

       An  earth radius multiplier of 1.333 instructs SPLAT! to use the "four-
       thirds earth" model for line-of-sight propagation analysis.  Any appro-
       priate earth radius multiplier may be selected by the user.

       When performing a regional analysis, SPLAT! generates a site report for
       each station analyzed.  SPLAT! site  reports  contain  details  of  the
       site's  geographic  location,  its  height  above  mean  sea level, the
       antenna's height above mean sea level, the antenna's height above aver-
       age  terrain,  and  the height of the average terrain calculated toward
       the bearings of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees azimuth.

DETERMINING MULTIPLE REGIONS OF LOS COVERAGE
       SPLAT!  can  also  display  line-of-sight coverage areas for as many as
       four separate transmitter sites on a common topographic map.  For exam-
       ple:

       splat -t site1 site2 site3 site4 -c 10.0 -metric -o network.ppm

       plots  the  regional line-of-sight coverage of site1, site2, site3, and
       site4 based on a receive  antenna  located  10.0  meters  above  ground
       level.  A topographic map is then written to the file network.ppm.  The
       line-of-sight coverage area of the transmitters are plotted as  follows
       in  the  colors indicated (along with their corresponding RGB values in
       decimal):

           site1: Green (0,255,0)
           site2: Cyan (0,255,255)
           site3: Medium Violet (147,112,219)
           site4: Sienna 1 (255,130,71)

           site1 + site2: Yellow (255,255,0)
           site1 + site3: Pink (255,192,203)
           site1 + site4: Green Yellow (173,255,47)
           site2 + site3: Orange (255,165,0)
           site2 + site4: Dark Sea Green 1 (193,255,193)
           site3 + site4: Dark Turquoise (0,206,209)

           site1 + site2 + site3: Dark Green (0,100,0)
           site1 + site2 + site4: Blanched Almond (255,235,205)
           site1 + site3 + site4: Medium Spring Green (0,250,154)
           site2 + site3 + site4: Tan (210,180,140)

           site1 + site2 + site3 + site4: Gold2 (238,201,0)

       If separate .qth files are generated, each representing a  common  site
       location  but  a  different  antenna  height,  a single topographic map
       illustrating the regional coverage from as many as four separate  loca-
       tions on a single tower may be generated by SPLAT!.

PATH LOSS ANALYSIS
       If the -c switch is replaced by a -L switch, an ITM path loss map for a
       transmitter site may be generated:

       splat -t wnjt -L 30.0 -s cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat -o path_loss_map

       In this mode, SPLAT! generates a multi-color map illustrating  expected
       signal  levels  in areas surrounding the transmitter site.  A legend at
       the bottom of the map correlates each color with a specific  path  loss
       range in decibels.

       The  -db switch allows a threshold to be set beyond which contours will
       not be plotted on the map.  For example, if a path loss beyond -140  dB
       is  irrelevant  to  the survey being conducted, SPLAT!'s path loss plot
       can be constrained to the region bounded by the 140 dB attenuation con-
       tour as follows:

       splat  -t  wnjt-dt  -L  30.0  -s  cities.dat -b co34_d00.dat -db 140 -o
       plot.ppm

       The path loss contour threshold may be expressed as either  a  positive
       or negative quantity.

       The  path  loss  analysis range may be modified to a user-specific dis-
       tance using the -R switch.  The argument must be  given  in  miles  (or
       kilometers  if  the -metric switch is used).  If a range wider than the
       generated topographic map is specified, SPLAT! will  perform  ITM  path
       loss  calculations between all four corners of the area prediction map.

       The colors used to illustrate contour regions in SPLAT! generated  cov-
       erage  maps  may  be  tailored  by  the  user  by creating or modifying
       SPLAT!'s color definition files.  SPLAT! color  definition  files  have
       the  same  base  name  as  the transmitter's .qth file, but carry .lcf,
       .scf, and .dcf extensions.  If the necessary file does not exist in the
       current  working  when  SPLAT!  is run, a file containing default color
       definition parameters that is suitable for manual editing by  the  user
       is written into the current directory.

       When  a regional ITM analysis is performed and the transmitter's ERP is
       not specified or is zero, a .lcf path loss color definition file corre-
       sponding to the transmitter site (.qth) is read by SPLAT! from the cur-
       rent working directory.  If a .lcf file corresponding to the  transmit-
       ter  site is not found, then a default file suitable for manual editing
       by the user is automatically generated by SPLAT!.

       A path loss color definition file  possesses  the  following  structure
       (wnjt-dt.lcf):

        ;  SPLAT!  Auto-generated  Path-Loss  Color Definition ("wnjt-dt.lcf")
       File
        ;
        ; Format for the parameters held in this file is as follows:
        ;
        ;    dB: red, green, blue
        ;
        ; ...where "dB" is the path loss (in dB) and
        ; "red", "green", and "blue" are the corresponding RGB color
        ; definitions ranging from 0 to 255 for the region specified.
        ;
        ; The following parameters may be edited and/or expanded
        ; for future runs of SPLAT!  A total of 32 contour regions
        ; may be defined in this file.
        ;
        ;
         80: 255,   0,   0
         90: 255, 128,   0
        100: 255, 165,   0
        110: 255, 206,   0
        120: 255, 255,   0
        130: 184, 255,   0
        140:   0, 255,   0
        150:   0, 208,   0
        160:   0, 196, 196
        170:   0, 148, 255
        180:  80,  80, 255
        190:   0,  38, 255
        200: 142,  63, 255
        210: 196,  54, 255
        220: 255,   0, 255
        230: 255, 194, 204

       If the path loss is less than 80 dB, the color Red (RGB = 255, 0, 0) is
       assigned  to  the region.  If the path loss is greater than or equal to
       80 dB, but less than 90 db, then Dark Orange (255, 128, 0) is  assigned
       to  the  region.   Orange (255, 165, 0) is assigned to regions having a
       path loss greater than or equal to 90 dB, but less than 100 dB, and  so
       on.   Greyscale  terrain  is displayed beyond the 230 dB path loss con-
       tour. Adding the -sc switch will smooth  the  transitions  between  the
       specified quantized contour levels.

FIELD STRENGTH ANALYSIS
       If the transmitter's effective radiated power (ERP) is specified in the
       transmitter's .lrp file, or expressed on  the  command-line  using  the
       -erp  switch,  field  strength contours referenced to decibels over one
       microvolt per meter (dBuV/m) rather than path loss are produced:

       splat -t wnjt-dt -L 30.0 -erp 46000 -db 30 -o plot.ppm

       The -db switch can be used in this mode as before to limit  the  extent
       to  which  field  strength  contours  are plotted.  When plotting field
       strength contours, however, the argument given is interpreted as  being
       expressed in dBuV/m.

       SPLAT!  field  strength  color  definition  files  share a very similar
       structure to .lcf files used for plotting path loss:

        ; SPLAT! Auto-generated Signal Color Definition ("wnjt-dt.scf") File
        ;
        ; Format for the parameters held in this file is as follows:
        ;
        ;    dBuV/m: red, green, blue
        ;
        ; ...where "dBuV/m" is the signal strength (in dBuV/m) and
        ; "red", "green", and "blue" are the corresponding RGB color
        ; definitions ranging from 0 to 255 for the region specified.
        ;
        ; The following parameters may be edited and/or expanded
        ; for future runs of SPLAT!  A total of 32 contour regions
        ; may be defined in this file.

       If the signal strength is greater than or equal to 128 dB over 1 micro-
       volt per meter (dBuV/m), the color Red (255, 0, 0) is displayed for the
       region.  If the signal strength is greater than or equal to 118 dBuV/m,
       but  less  than 128 dBuV/m, then the color Orange (255, 165, 0) is dis-
       played, and so on.  Greyscale terrain is  displayed  for  regions  with
       signal strengths less than 8 dBuV/m.

       Signal  strength contours for some common VHF and UHF broadcasting ser-
       vices in the United States are as follows:

RECEIVED POWER LEVEL ANALYSIS
       If the transmitter's effective radiated power (ERP) is specified in the
       transmitter's  .lrp  file,  or  expressed on the command-line using the
       -erp switch, and the -dbm switch is invoked, received power level  con-
       tours referenced to decibels over one milliwatt (dBm) are produced:

       splat -t wnjt-dt -L 30.0 -erp 46000 -dbm -db -100 -o plot.ppm

       The  -db switch can be used to limit the extent to which received power
       level contours are plotted.  When plotting power  level  contours,  the
       argument given is interpreted as being expressed in dBm.

       SPLAT! received power level color definition files share a very similar
       structure to the color definition files described earlier, except  that
       the  power  levels  in  dBm may be either positive or negative, and are
       limited to a range between +40 dBm and -200 dBm:

ANTENNA RADIATION PATTERN PARAMETERS
       Normalized field voltage patterns for a transmitting antenna's horizon-
       tal  and  vertical planes are imported automatically into SPLAT! when a
       path loss, field strength, or received power level coverage analysis is
       performed.   Antenna  pattern  data is read from a pair of files having
       the same base name as the transmitter and LRP files, but with  .az  and
       .el  extensions  for azimuth and elevation pattern files, respectively.
       Specifications regarding pattern rotation (if any) and mechanical  beam
       tilt  and  tilt  direction  (if  any)  are also contained within SPLAT!
       antenna pattern files.

       For example, the first few lines of a SPLAT! azimuth pattern file might
       appear as follows (kvea.az):

               183.0
               0       0.8950590
               1       0.8966406
               2       0.8981447
               3       0.8995795
               4       0.9009535
               5       0.9022749
               6       0.9035517
               7       0.9047923
               8       0.9060051

       The  first  line of the .az file specifies the amount of azimuthal pat-
       tern rotation (measured clockwise in degrees from  True  North)  to  be
       applied  by SPLAT! to the data contained in the .az file.  This is fol-
       lowed by azimuth headings (0 to 360 degrees) and their associated  nor-
       malized field patterns (0.000 to 1.000) separated by whitespace.

       The  structure of SPLAT! elevation pattern files is slightly different.
       The first line of the .el file specifies the amount of mechanical  beam
       tilt  applied  to  the  antenna.   Note that a downward tilt (below the
       horizon) is expressed as a positive angle, while an upward tilt  (above
       the  horizon)  is expressed as a negative angle.  This data is followed
       by the azimuthal direction of the tilt, separated by whitespace.

       The remainder of the file consists of elevation angles and their corre-
       sponding  normalized  voltage radiation pattern (0.000 to 1.000) values
       separated by whitespace.  Elevation angles must  be  specified  over  a
       -10.0  to  +90.0  degree  range.  As was the convention with mechanical
       beamtilt, negative elevation angles are used  to  represent  elevations
       above  the  horizon,  while positive angles represents elevations below
       the horizon.

       For example, the first few lines a SPLAT! elevation pattern file  might
       appear as follows (kvea.el):

               1.1    130.0
              -10.0   0.172
              -9.5    0.109
              -9.0    0.115
              -8.5    0.155
              -8.0    0.157
              -7.5    0.104
              -7.0    0.029
              -6.5    0.109
              -6.0    0.185

       In  this  example,  the  antenna  is  mechanically  tilted downward 1.1
       degrees towards an azimuth of 130.0 degrees.

       For best results, the resolution of  azimuth  pattern  data  should  be
       specified  to  the  nearest  degree azimuth, and elevation pattern data
       resolution should be specified to the nearest  0.01  degrees.   If  the
       pattern  data specified does not reach this level of resolution, SPLAT!
       will interpolate the values provided  to  determine  the  data  at  the
       required resolution, although this may result in a loss in accuracy.

EXPORTING AND IMPORTING REGIONAL CONTOUR DATA
       Performing  a  regional coverage analysis based on an ITM path analysis
       can be a very time consuming process, especially  if  the  analysis  is
       performed  repeatedly  to  discover what effects changes to a transmit-
       ter's antenna radiation pattern make to the predicted coverage area.

       This process can be expedited by exporting the contour data produced by
       SPLAT!  to  an  alphanumeric output (.ano) file.  The data contained in
       this file can then be modified to incorporate antenna pattern  effects,
       and imported back into SPLAT! to quickly produce a revised contour map.
       Depending on the way in which SPLAT! is  invoked,  alphanumeric  output
       files  can  describe  regional  path loss, signal strength, or received
       signal power levels.

       For example, an alphanumeric output file containing path loss  informa-
       tion can be generated by SPLAT! for a receive site 30 feet above ground
       level over a 50 mile radius surrounding a transmitter site to a maximum
       path loss of 140 dB (assuming ERP is not specified in the transmitter's
       .lrp file) using the following syntax:

       splat -t kvea -L 30.0 -R 50.0 -db 140 -ano pathloss.dat

       If ERP is specified in the .lrp file or on the command line through the
       -erp  switch,  the  alphanumeric  output file will instead contain pre-
       dicted field values in dBuV/m.  If the  -dBm  command  line  switch  is
       used,  then  the  alphanumeric  output file will contain receive signal
       power levels in dBm.

       SPLAT! alphanumeric output files can exceed many hundreds of  megabytes
       in  size.   They  contain information relating to the boundaries of the
       region they describe followed by latitudes (degrees North),  longitudes
       (degrees West), azimuths (referenced to True North), elevations (to the
       first obstruction), followed by either  path  loss  (in  dB),  received
       field  strength  (in  dBuV/m),  or received signal power level (in dBm)
       without regard to the transmitting antenna's radiation pattern.

       The first few lines of a SPLAT! alphanumeric output file could take  on
       the following appearance (pathloss.dat):

               119, 117    ; max_west, min_west
               35, 34      ; max_north, min_north

       Comments  can  be  placed  in the file if they are preceeded by a semi-
       colon.  The vim text editor has proven capable of editing files of this
       size.

       Note  as  was the case in the antenna pattern files, negative elevation
       angles refer to upward tilt (above the horizon), while positive  angles
       refer  to downward tilt (below the horizon).  These angles refer to the
       elevation to the receiving antenna at the  height  above  ground  level
       specified  using  the  -L  switch  if  the path between transmitter and
       receiver is unobstructed.  If the  path  between  the  transmitter  and
       receiver  is  obstructed,  an  asterisk (*) is placed on the end of the
       line, and the elevation angle returned by SPLAT! refers  the  elevation
       angle  to  the  first  obstruction  rather than the geographic location
       specified on the line.  This is done in response to the fact  that  the
       ITM  model  considers  the  energy  reaching  a  distant  point over an
       obstructed path to be the result of the energy scattered over  the  top
       of the first obstruction along the path.  Since energy cannot reach the
       obstructed location directly, the actual elevation angle to the  desti-
       nation over such a path becomes irrelevant.

       When  modifying SPLAT! path loss files to reflect antenna pattern data,
       only the last numeric column should be amended to reflect the antenna's
       normalized  gain  at  the azimuth and elevation angles specified in the
       file.  Programs and scripts capable of performing this task are left as
       an exercise for the user.

       Modified  alphanumeric  output  files  can be imported back into SPLAT!
       for generating revised coverage maps provided that  the  ERP  and  -dBm
       options  are  used  as  they were when the alphanumeric output file was
       originally generated:

       splat -t kvea -ani pathloss.dat -s city.dat -b county.dat -o map.ppm

       Note that alphanumeric output files generated by splat cannot  be  used
       with  splat-hd,  or  vice-versa  due  to the resolution incompatibility
       between the two versions of the program.  Also, each of the three types
       of  alphanumeric  output  files are incompatible with one another, so a
       file containing path loss data cannot be imported into SPLAT!  to  pro-
       duce signal strength or received power level contours, etc.

USER-DEFINED TERRAIN INPUT FILES
       A  user-defined  terrain  file is a user-generated text file containing
       latitudes, longitudes, and heights above ground level of specific  ter-
       rain features believed to be of importance to the SPLAT! analysis being
       conducted, but noticeably absent from the  SDF  files  being  used.   A
       user-defined  terrain file is imported into a SPLAT! analysis using the
       -udt switch:

        splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -udt udt_file.txt -o map.ppm

       A user-defined terrain file has the following appearance and structure:

              40.32180556, 74.1325, 100.0 meters
              40.321805, 74.1315, 300.0
              40.3218055, 74.1305, 100.0 meters

       Terrain  height  is interpreted as being described in feet above ground
       level unless followed by the word meters, and is added on  top  of  the
       terrain  specified  in  the  SDF  data for the locations specified.  Be
       aware that each user-defined terrain feature specified will  be  inter-
       preted  as  being 3-arc seconds in both latitude and longitude in splat
       and 1 arc-second in  latitude  and  longitude  in  splat-hd.   Features
       described  in  the  user-defined  terrain  file that overlap previously
       defined features in the file are ignored by SPLAT! to avoid  ambiguity.

GROUND CLUTTER
       The height of ground clutter can be specified using the -gc switch:

             splat -t wnjt-dt -r kd2bd -gc 30.0 -H wnjt-dt_path.png

       The  -gc  switch  as  the  effect of raising the overall terrain by the
       specified amount in feet (or meters if the -metric switch is  invoked),
       except  over  areas  at sea-level and at the transmitting and receiving
       antenna locations.

SIMPLE TOPOGRAPHIC MAP GENERATION
       In certain situations it may be desirable to generate a topographic map
       of  a  region  without plotting coverage areas, line-of-sight paths, or
       generating obstruction reports.  There are several ways of doing  this.
       If  one  wishes to generate a topographic map illustrating the location
       of a transmitter and receiver site  along  with  a  brief  text  report
       describing the locations and distances between the sites, the -n switch
       should be invoked as follows:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -n -o topo_map.ppm

       If no text report is desired, then the -N switch is used:

       splat -t tx_site -r rx_site -N -o topo_map.ppm

       If a topographic map centered about a single  site  out  to  a  minimum
       specified radius is desired instead, a command similar to the following
       can be used:

       splat -t tx_site -R 50.0 -s NJ_Cities -b NJ_Counties -o topo_map.ppm

       where -R specifies the minimum radius of the map in miles  (or  kilome-
       ters  if  the  -metric switch is used).  Note that the tx_site name and
       location are not displayed in this example.  If display of this  infor-
       mation  is  desired,  simply  create a SPLAT! city file (-s option) and
       append it to the list of command-line options illustrated above.

       If the -o switch and output filename are omitted in  these  operations,
       topographic  output  is written to a file named tx_site.ppm in the cur-
       rent working directory by default.

GEOREFERENCE FILE GENERATION
       Topographic, coverage (-c), and path loss contour (-L)  maps  generated
       by  SPLAT!  may be imported into Xastir (X Amateur Station Tracking and
       Information Reporting) software by generating a georeference file using
       SPLAT!'s -geo switch:

       splat -t kd2bd -R 50.0 -s NJ_Cities -b NJ_Counties -geo -o map.ppm

       The  georeference file generated will have the same base name as the -o
       file specified, but have a  .geo extension, and permit proper interpre-
       tation and display of SPLAT!'s .ppm graphics in Xastir software.

GOOGLE MAP KML FILE GENERATION
       Keyhole  Markup Language files compatible with Google Earth may be gen-
       erated by SPLAT! when performing point-to-point  or  regional  coverage
       analyses by invoking the -kml switch:

       splat -t wnjt-dt -r kd2bd -kml

       The  KML file generated will have the same filename structure as a Path
       Analysis Report for the transmitter  and  receiver  site  names  given,
       except it will carry a  .kml extension.

       Once  loaded into Google Earth (File --> Open), the KML file will anno-
       tate the map display with the names of  the  transmitter  and  receiver
       site  locations.   The viewpoint of the image will be from the position
       of the transmitter site looking towards the location of  the  receiver.
       The  point-to-point path between the sites will be displayed as a white
       line while the RF  line-of-sight  path  will  be  displayed  in  green.
       Google  Earth's  navigation  tools  allow  the user to "fly" around the
       path, identify landmarks, roads, and other featured content.

       When performing regional coverage analysis, the  .kml file generated by
       SPLAT!  will permit path loss or signal strength contours to be layered
       on top of Google Earth's display along with a corresponding  color  key
       in  the  upper left-hand corner.  The generated .kml file will have the
       same basename as that of the .ppm file normally generated.

DETERMINATION OF ANTENNA HEIGHT ABOVE AVERAGE TERRAIN
       SPLAT! determines antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) according
       to  the  procedure  defined  by  Federal Communications Commission Part
       73.313(d).  According to  this  definition,  terrain  elevations  along
       eight  radials  between  2  and 10 miles (3 and 16 kilometers) from the
       site being analyzed are sampled and averaged for  each  45  degrees  of
       azimuth  starting with True North.  If one or more radials lie entirely
       over water or over land outside the United States (areas for  which  no
       USGS topography data is available), then those radials are omitted from
       the calculation of average terrain.

       Note that SRTM-3 elevation data, unlike older USGS data, extends beyond
       the  borders  of the United States.  Therefore, HAAT results may not be
       in full compliance with FCC Part 73.313(d) in areas along  the  borders
       of  the United States if the SDF files used by SPLAT! are SRTM-derived.

       When performing point-to-point terrain analysis, SPLAT! determines  the
       antenna  height  above  average terrain only if enough topographic data
       has already been loaded by the program to  perform  the  point-to-point
       analysis.   In  most cases, this will be true, unless the site in ques-
       tion does not lie within 10 miles of the  boundary  of  the  topography
       data in memory.

       When  performing  area  prediction  analysis, enough topography data is
       normally loaded by SPLAT!  to  perform  average  terrain  calculations.
       Under  such  conditions,  SPLAT!  will provide the antenna height above
       average terrain as well as the average terrain above mean sea level for
       azimuths of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees, and include
       such information in the generated site report.  If one or more  of  the
       eight  radials  surveyed  fall over water, or over regions for which no
       SDF data is available, SPLAT! reports No Terrain for the  radial  paths
       affected.
