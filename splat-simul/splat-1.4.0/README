    ======================================================================
    SPLAT!: A Terrestrial RF Path and Terrain Analysis Tool for Unix/Linux
    ======================================================================


Requirements
============
SPLAT! requires the libbzip2-1.0.1 (or later) compression library and
header files for successful compilation.  bzip2/libbzip2 is available
at: http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/

SPLAT! also requires the zlib general purpose compression library.
Any recent version included with your Linux distribution should work
fine.  Note, however, that zlib version 1.1.3 contains a security
vulnerability that has been fixed in version 1.1.4.  The latest
version of zlib may be found at: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
If you should decide to build zlib, it is important to invoke:

	./configure -s

to build zlib as a shared library.

If you wish to plot terrain and elevation profiles through SPLAT!,
you will need gnuplot.  The latest version of gnuplot is available
at: http://www.gnuplot.info/ if you don't already have it.

You will also need an application for viewing large PPM graphics
files generated by SPLAT!.  XV, ImageMagick, XPaint, and The GIMP
all perform this task well (especially The GIMP).

It goes without saying that a C++ compiler (gcc/g++) and math libraries
are also needed to build SPLAT!  SPLAT! is fully compatible with the
latest versions of the GCC compiler.


Installation Instructions
=========================
Unpack the tar.gz file in a source code directory (such as /usr/src
under Slackware) as 'root':

	cd /usr/src
	tar xvfz splat-1.3.0.tar.gz

This action will generate a subdirectory named splat-1.3.0.

Next, cd into the directory:

	cd splat-1.3.0

Invoke the configure script to build SPLAT! and related utilities:

	./configure

If you are 'root', SPLAT! and its related man page and utilities will
be installed after the compilation process is complete.  If not, you
will be prompted to su to 'root' and invoke the install script manually:

	su root
	Password:
	./install all
	exit

Before running SPLAT!, carefully read the documentation located under
the splat-1.3.0/docs directory for information on the use of the program.
Some sample data files are located under the splat-1.3.0/sample_data
directory.

REMEMBER: Topography data must be downloaded and SPLAT Data Files must
be generated using the included srtm2sdf, postdownload, or usgs2sdf
utilities before using SPLAT!  Instructions for doing so are included
in the documentation.

It is a good practice to create a working directory for SPLAT! use
under your home directory:

	mkdir $HOME/splat-work

Then:
	cd $HOME/splat-work

before invoking SPLAT!

In this manner, all associated SPLAT! working files can be kept in a
common directory.

It is important to realize that when analyzing regional coverage
areas of transmitters, repeaters, or cell sites, SPLAT Data Files
need to be available for the entire region surrounding the site(s)
being analyzed.  SPLAT Data Files can be placed under your SPLAT!
working directory, or under a separate directory specified in your
$HOME/.splat_path file so SPLAT! can easily find them.

Please read the README file under the utils directory for information
on the utilities included with SPLAT!.

Please read the documentation under the splat-1.3.0/docs directory,
or consult the program's man page for more information and examples
of SPLAT! use.

The latest announcements and information regarding SPLAT! software
can be found on the SPLAT! Web Site:
