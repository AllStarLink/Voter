  You will need to have :

    MySQL, version 5.0 or greater
    Perl 5.0.0 or greater, with DBI package and mysql driver
    A web server, such as Apache 2.2
    

1.  Compile and install SPLAT!.

    tar jxvf splat-1.2.1.tar.bz2
    cd splat-1.2.1
    make
    su make install


2.  Your local mysql installation has a database administrator (root user) -
    Using that account :

    You will want a new db user, possibly named "splat", with a password,
    which we assume to be  "rst599".  You really should use another password,
    which you should set in "create.mysql" before you do the next step.

    mysql -p -u root < create.mysql

    If you change the password in "create.mysql", please remember it
    for a later step.

3.  The file "Site.tar.bz2" contains both the Perl code, and
    a directory structure.  Unpack it in the directory of your
    web server where you want SPLAT to be.

    mkdir public_html/SPLAT

    cd public_html/SPLAT
    tar jxvf Site.tar.bz2


4.  There is now a directory underneath the SPLAT directory named "SDF".
    That directory needs to be populated with the various terrain data
    files that you will want.

    If you are only interested in North_America, then copy only the

    North_America.tar.bz2
    
    file from splat.ecok.edu.  If you live in Europe, copy the Eurasia
    files, and so forth.  (You can copy all of the files if you want to
    have a site which can handle world-wide plots.  A complete installation
    will require less than 20 GB of disk space.)

    Unpack that file.

    cd public_SPLAT
    tar jxvf North_America.bz2

5.  If you live in the United States, copy the files

      USA.tar.bz2
      
     and unpack it inside the SPLAT directory:


     ie
     cd SPLAT; tar jxvf USA.tar.bz2

     This  file contains city and political boundary information
     from the US Geological Survey.  If you don't live in the US, you
     may want to not bother with this file.  The CGI
     scripts will use it, but will find nothing useful.  

6.  There is a file called "DB.pl", which you must edit if you changed
    the database password in the step above.
    You must also set the SPLATHOME variable in that file.


7.  Check permissions, and let 'er rip!

    find SPLAT -type d -print | xargs chmod ugo+rx
    find SPLAT -print | xarg chmod ugo+r
    find SPLAT -name "*pl" -print | xargs chmod ugo+rx
    chmod ugo+rwx PLOTS call_locations.txt

   If you understand your server you can tighten these
   permissions down somewhat - especially the last chmod.

   The file "call_locations.txt" is written every time a station
   is registered, and the PLOTS directory is written every time
   a plot is generated.  The "writer" is the web server (typically
   "apache").  All that is really needed is to

      chgrp apache PLOTS call_locations.txt
      chmod ug=rwx,o-rwx PLOTS
      chmod ug=rw,o-rwx call_locations.txt


8.  You may want a cronjob periodically to clean up the PLOTS
    directory.
    
42 * * * * /usr/bin/find PLOTS  -type d -name "[0-9]*" -mmin +60  | /usr/bin/xargs -/bin/rm -rf >/dev/null 2>&1

  will remove all plots more than an hour old. (They DO pile up!)


9.  There are some tools in the Tools directory which may be useful.

10.  If you are doing multiple transmitter plots, you may have to adjust
     the timeout parameter for your web server.

     In Apache the configuration file conf/extra/httpd-default.conf
     set

     # Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
     Timeout 600

     works for me.
